# Text Emotion Classification

# Overview

This project aims to classify text into different emotion categories using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of various text samples labeled with emotions, and a model is trained to predict the emotional category of new text inputs.

# Features

Preprocessing of text data

Machine learning-based emotion classification

Model training and evaluation

Dataset analysis and visualization

# Dataset

The dataset contains text samples labeled with emotions such as:

* Happiness

* Fear

* Anger

* Sadness

* Disgust

* Shame

* Guilt

# Technologies Used

* Python

* Jupyter Notebook

* Scikit-learn

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Matplotlib

# Installation

* Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MandalaMukesh2004/text-emotion-classification.git

* Navigate to the project directory:

cd text-emotion-classification

* Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Run the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.

Modify and experiment with different models and datasets.

# Results
